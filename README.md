### NOTE:
1. Students can only login to the specific session , if the teacher has uploaded the xlsx file with the registration numbers of students.( so that no other students from other class can login for the session).  
2. The passkey/password for the teacaher's account will be provided by the Admin, which can be modified upon teacher's request.   
3. while creating session, session time will be set for any date and time( i.e it can be live or scheduled).   
4. By default, session data will be set to today's date(date when teacher is creating session), and default session start time will be current  time and session end time will be current time + 30 minutes.

   Live class will be provided red live indicator and end time will be mentioned for each session ( Ex: This session will expire in 30 min(it will be a running time) or we will show the exact session expire time Ex:" This session will expire at 2:30 pm").
   Out of both live and schedules session links, live will be active while scheduled will be disabled.
   Scheduled button will be disabled(It wont work when pressed, it will only work when its session time matches with the current time). In this we will show session time for which it will be valid or active.

7. The sessions will be either shown in tabular format or box format.
